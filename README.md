# machine-learning
exercise of ML
I'm a student.this is my exercise for machine learning.
I'm just want to practise all kind of learning from formula to code.

Now ,I found that use matrix operation instead of for loop is awesome, that way of coding makes my code clean and looked effective!
I'll keep practice!
