# machine-learning
## Introduction
I'm a student.this is my exercise for machine learning.
I'm just want to practise all kind of learning from formula to code.

## Experience
I found that using matrix operation instead of for-loop is awesome, that way of coding makes my code clean and looked effective! It is important to mark the dimension of each matrix in this operation. And there are two kinds of numpy objects in python. One of the two is Ndarray,which uses "np.array()" to create, and the other is matrix, which use "np.mat()" to create. The second one is the best for matrix operation.
I'll keep practice!
